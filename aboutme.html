<h6>Avatar</h6>

Avatar is one of the most creative pieces of cinematography and has made more things in film achievable. 
CGI has made it possible to create entire worlds and scenes that could never have been achieved with traditional effects. 
The movie has many sweeping shots that excited viewers with the soaring view of Pandora
Every Na'vi costume was built in real life.
James Horner invented many of the instruments used in the movie's score.
Cars factored into Cameron's creature design.
Cameron used two different 3D camera rigs to shoot Avatar.

  <blockquote>Given a graph and a source vertex in the graph, find the shortest paths from the source to all vertices in the given graph.Dijkstra’s algorithm is very similar to Prim’s algorithm for minimum spanning tree.
 Like Prim’s MST, we generate a SPT (shortest path tree) with a given source as a root. We maintain two sets, one set contains vertices included in the shortest-path tree, other set includes vertices not yet included in the shortest-path tree.
At every step of the algorithm, we find a vertex that is in the other set (set of not yet included) and has a minimum distance from the source.</blockquote>
